# Search-Engine-Application
Developed a message search and keyword highlighting system with React and TypeScript.
- Enables users to look up past messages with a single-word query.
- Highlights all occurrences of the query within messages, facilitating quick retrieval of relevant information.
- Implements efficient search techniques and constructs suffix arrays for potential performance enhancements.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was created with [Create React App]:

### `npm create-react-app search-engine-app`
### `cd search-engine-app`

Install React and React Hooks:

### `npm install react react-dom`
### `npm install @types/react-use`

Install TypeScript:

### `npm install typescript @types/react @types/react-dom`

Install Babel:

### `npm install @babel/core @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react @babel/preset-typescript babel-loader`

Install Webpack:

### `npm install webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server html-webpack-plugin`

Install Jest:

### `npm install jest ts-jest @types/jest`

Install React Testing Libraries:

### `npm install @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom @testing-library/user-event`

Install ESLint and Prettier:

### `npm install eslint @typescript-eslint/parser @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin eslint-plugin-react`
### `npm install prettier eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-prettier`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Run the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

Copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project to have complete access.
